## Rearrange windows when you re-dock your laptop

I'm tired of always rearranging windows when I leave my desk to go to
a meeting with my laptop. I alway have to go one application to the
following restoring their previous position and size. This is quite
annoying.

To sove this problem, I've developed a small tool to load window
positions and sizes, write a configuration file and be able to restore
the application windows to their previous sizes and positions.

It is a *tool* so don't expect to be a production class application.
